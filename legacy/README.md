# RSClues
A website based clue solver for old school runescape, see it live at http://www.rsclues.com

## Why is this on git now?

Due to time constraints, I'm struggling to find time to develop this project into what I wanted it to be, so If I'm to open it up to the public hopefully they can help contribute to the website! Even if no one contributes, atleast I have bug tracking and I can share with my code with anyone who wants to develop stuff for old school runescape.

## Why would I help you?

Perhaps you've just started development and want a real world project to practice on? Perhaps you like using rsclues.com but get sick of the time it takes me to udpate it everytime there is a slight update to clues.

I don't take any money/adrevenue from this site so there is nothing for me to gain on this.

## How was this site built?

This site is now built in raw php, it uses no databases so it should be fast and very easy for you to replicate on a simple webserver such as wamp.

## Can I just use your code for my own project?

Absolutely! If you think any of the data scraped by me, or any of the code in this project may help you develop your own site, I'd encourage it and I'd love to see what you make.

## Planned Features

1. Add more info to clues in terms of requirements
