# RSClues
A website based clue solver for old school runescape, see it live at http://www.rsclues.com

## Why is this on git now?

Due to time constraints, I'm struggling to find time to develop this project into what I wanted it to be, so If I'm to open it up to the public hopefully they can help contribute to the website! Even if no one contributes, atleast I have bug tracking and I can share with my code with anyone who wants to develop stuff for old school runescape.

## Why would I help you?

Perhaps you've just started development and want a real world project to practice on? Perhaps you like using rsclues.com but get sick of the time it takes me to udpate it everytime there is a slight update to clues.

I don't take any money/adrevenue from this site so there is nothing for me to gain on this.
